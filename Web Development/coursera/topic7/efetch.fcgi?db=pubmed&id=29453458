    abstract "Successful replication of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1
 depends on the expression of various cellular host factors, such as the
 interleukin-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), a member of the protein family
 of TEC-tyrosine kinases. ITK is selectively expressed in T-cells and
 coordinates signaling pathways downstream of the T-cell receptor and
 chemokine receptors, including PLC-1 activation, Ca(2+)-release,
 transcription factor mobilization, and actin rearrangements. The exact role
 of ITK during HIV-1 infection is still unknown. We analyzed the function of
 ITK during HIV-1 replication and showed that attachment, fusion of virions
 with the cell membrane and entry into Jurkat T-cells was inhibited when ITK
 was knocked down. In contrast, reverse transcription and provirus expression
 were not affected by ITK deficiency. Inhibited ITK expression did not affect
 the CXCR4 receptor on the cell surface, whereas CD4 and LFA-1 integrin levels
 were slightly enhanced in ITK knockdown cells and heparan sulfate (HS)
 expression was completely abolished in ITK depleted T-cells. However, neither
 HS expression nor other attachment factors could explain the impaired HIV-1
 binding to ITK-deficient cells, which suggests that a more complex cellular
 process is influenced by ITK or that not yet discovered molecules contribute
 to restriction of HIV-1 binding and entry.",
